## User Experience

### Plan

As someone who has a pet in the family, and where the pet is treated as an equal family member, I understand the struggles when you cannot find everything on one place.
This is why this website is created. The main purpose of this website is to provide all the necessary and essential products, together with other useful things to keep your pet happy and safe.

### User Stories

Reason why creating this website:

- be a place where visitor can create their profile by registering 
- be a place where visitor can login, and update its personal details (for the billing and shipping purposes)
- be a place where visitors can look for specific items for their pets
- be a place where visitors can look for new deals, clearance items, and discounted items
- be a place where visitors can search for a specific item
- be a place where visitor can at any time look at its purchase history and possibly re-order
